# Git Practice Exercises

This repository contains some a very fake web application, some sample branches and some explanatory text
to help understand and practice some git concepts.

## How to Use

These exercises are designed to be stepped through in order, and require some coordination of branches to
get the repository in the right state. If you have a faciliatator, they can do the parts marked _Facilitator_
otherwise you can do them yourself.

Either way, everyone doing the exercise should **fork the repository**!
